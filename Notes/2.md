- router: forward traffic between networks
- state maintained on server
- Organize layers
  - Decompose problems into tasks
  - Origanize tasks
  - Assign task to entities (layers)
- Layers
  - application: discord ...
  - built on reliable or unreliable transport
  - best effort _global_ packet delivery
    - routes via IP
  - best effort _local_ packet delivery
    - routes via MAC
  - physical transfer: ethernet etc
- OSI: Open Systems Interconnection
  - Application
  - Presentation (DONT care)
  - Session (dont care)
  - Transport
  - Network
  - Data Link
  - Physical
- Protocol: how to communicate between parties
  - Defines syntax of communication
  - Defines semantics
    |Layer|Protocol|
    |-|-|
    |Application| HTTP, DNS, SMTP|
    | Transport | TCP, UDP|
    | Network | IP|
    | Data LInk | Ethernet|
    | Physical | Optical, Copper, Radio|
- Network
  - Implements L1 (wire), L2 (switch), L3 (router)
  - switch vs router
    - switch doesn't route via IP, router does
- IP
  - the only protocol for network layer
    - decouples applications from low-level tech
      - suppport innovatioln above and below IP
    - make changing IP hard (IPv4 -> IPv6)
- E2E argument
  - make dumb network, smart end systems
  - network is hard to upgrade, so reduce complexity of the network
  - so that dont need to upgrade network components, just end systems
